			`Generate comprehensive unit and integration tests for my Go project. The project's entire code resides in the "app" folder. Your task is to review only the code within this folder (using the "list_files" functionality) and then generate complete test files (i.e., *_test.go) without modifying any existing code files or the go.mod file.
			Task: Execute Comprehensive Automated Testing  
			Objective: Validate the project's functionality with robust and exhaustive tests.
			
			Requirements:
			- Write tests that cover all critical code paths.
			- Follow best practices for unit and integration testing in Go.
			- Ensure robust error handling in test cases.
			- All tests must pass before deployment.
			- Continuous integration should automatically verify test results.
			- Test logs must include detailed debugging information.
			
			Technical Constraints:
			- Use Go's built-in testing package for unit tests.
			- Utilize httptest for testing HTTP handlers.
			- Implement table-driven tests and organize them using t.Run() with descriptive scenario names.
			- Use the testify package for assertions where appropriate.
			- Include proper test teardown and cleanup routines.
			- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing.
			
			Important:
			- Do not modify the go.mod file or any existing code filesâ€”only create or update test files.
			
			Additional Guidance:
			- Ensure tests cover scenarios including successful execution, error cases, integration issues, and edge cases such as flaky tests.
			- The tests should be ready to run with 'go test'.
			
			Please generate complete test files that fully meet these requirements.`,
